# CS411 Project
Lab A4 Team 3's repository for BU CS 411.


## Project Requirements 
- 2 APIs
- OAuth
- Frontend/Backend 
- Database 


## Project Pitches
Pitch 1: This idea will be a map service where you input the destination into a website and it gives a route there and tells the user what the weather will be like during their biking trip. If it will rain or snow, the website will notify the user  and let them know to bring a raincoat and provide other tips. The two apis we’ll use are an api for the map(openmaps, mapbox, or some other free one) and an api for the weather(openweather). For Oauth and database, we’ll just store the user info in the database. 

Pitch 2: The gist of this idea is to give the website your steamid and then receive a list of game recommendations based on your top playtimes and favorite games. To get the user data we’ll use steam web api, and to get the recommendations we can use this (https://rapidapi.com/accujazz/api/rawg-video-games-database) api which has data on a lot of games stored in it. To get recommendations we can show games with similar genres and high metacritic scores to the users most played games.
